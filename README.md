Demonstration of SQL fluency to mobilize 15GB of grocery store data and extract answers from large datasets

This project demonstrates the usage of Python and SQL to make it possible to work with 15GB of data stored externally in Google Big Query. The project was broken
down into three tasks, all of which are described in the repository. The first task was to establish a connection between Python, SQL, and Google Big Query and load the data into a usable database. Clearly that is not possible locally. Then the other tasks were to answer specific questions via intricate SQL strategies. The code uses Python scripts to work within GBQ.
