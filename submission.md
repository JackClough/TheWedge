## Query Comparison Results

Fill in the following table with the results from the 
queries contained in `gbq_assessment_query.sql`. You only
need to fill in relative difference on the rows where it applies. 
When calculating relative difference, use the formula 
` (your_results - my_results)/my_results)`.

## Reflections

<!-- I'd love to get 100-200 words on your experience doing the Wedge Project --> 
I spent a great deal of time in the beginning of this just trying to figure out where to get the data and where to start.
Honestly, way too much time just finding my starting point. But, in the end, I really appreciate the work that went into
this and I have a huge apprecaition for data engineering. I think the grand total of hours I spent on this is a huge testimony
to the career as a whole.
